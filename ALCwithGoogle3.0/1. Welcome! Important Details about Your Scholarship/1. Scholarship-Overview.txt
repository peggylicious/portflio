Udacity forums
The primary space for connecting with your peers, mentors, and moderators is ALC on Slack. There are forums available in Udacity, but these forums are unmoderated and only for free course students. You are welcome to use them, but you will not get a response from your scholarship support network.

We highly recommend you use Slack for all questions and communication around this challenge course! Don't forget, your participation in Slack is one factor that will contribute to identifying our top performers and ND scholarship recipients.
