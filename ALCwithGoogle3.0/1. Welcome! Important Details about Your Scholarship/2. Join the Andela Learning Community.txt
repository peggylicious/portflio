ALC leverages the power of thousands of dedicated learners like you, as well as committed mentors and facilitators, to take your professional development as an aspiring world-class developer to the next level. ALC is a family! A new family must have a home to live in, a place to share ideas, learn, grow, and hear about exciting things that are happening. ALC lives in our online community tool, Slack.

To be a part of this network of learners and aspiring tech leaders, please join us on Slack. Use this helpful onboarding guide to get started.

When you join, please help drive the conversation! Welcome others, introduce yourself, ask the questions that you have and answer questions where you can. We look forward to you driving so many exciting conversations. We encourage you all to share resources, ask questions, seek help, and provide mentorship to one another.

We hope you will drive this community to new heights. Weâ€™re looking forward to supporting you on this journey.
