Google Udacity Scholarship Program


I started learning how to build websites in December of 2016, when I came across an wwww.edx.org mobile app on a friend's (Wofai) phone.
In May of 2018, I signed up for the Andela udacity Scholarship program. The Andela program has assisted my drive to improve on my skills
by introducing me to an online community of aspiring web developers from all over africa. There we share experiences, network and help each other with the courses problem sets from the Udacity Online School.
Learning how to build websites has been a superb experience for me and I would love to pen a few of my experiences here.

** Skills I have learnt.**
* To use the Mozilla Development Network(MDN) and StackOverflow.
* To build simple webpages using HTML.
* Understanding the use of trees in data science.
* Understanding the basics of Server.
* Difference between a Client and a Server.
* Understanding Local and External file paths.
* Http and Https protocols
* Difference between Tags and Elements


** What has been easy? **
* Formatting the document using paragraph &ltp&gt tags, bold &ltb&gt tags, and emphasis &ltem&gt tags.

** What has been difficult? **
* Letting go of the deprecated strike &ltstrike&gt tag and making use of the &ltsgt tag and &ltdel&gt tag, hich serve the same purpose to strile through a text.

** How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far? **
